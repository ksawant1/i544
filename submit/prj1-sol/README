The data is organized in three categories:
## Users The people associated with the blog. Each person can have one-or-more
         roles of admin, author or commenter (the admin role is not used in this
          project). Each user is identifed using an externally generated id.
## Articles The blog articles. Will have title and content fields, an authorId 
          identifying the author and a list of keywords. Each article is identifed
          using an internally generated id.
## Comments Comments associated with each blog article. A comment will have
          associated content. A comment will be associated with its corresponding
          article using its articleId and its commenter using its commenterId. 
          Each article is identifed using an internally generated id.
